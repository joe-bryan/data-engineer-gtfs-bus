Data pipeline that ingests data from the Massachusets Bay Transportation Authority (MBTA) to display which subways are delayed and by how much. Python code is used to extract the data from GTFS and GTFS-realtime sources into Google Cloud Storage. The data is further refined and written to BigQuery for analysis. Finally, a gold file is used to map the location of the delayed subways in the Streamlit dashboard.
